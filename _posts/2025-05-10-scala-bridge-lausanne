We are ecstatic to announce that Scala Bridge will take place in Lausanne before the Scala Days opening keynote on August 19th.

Scala Bridge is a completely free event to attend with the goal to support new members of the Scala community and those who are underrepresented in the tech industry as a whole. This inclusive event is hosted and supported by community leaders from throughout the Scala community, who spend the day mentoring those who join and answering their questions.


The hosts of this Scala Bridge edition are Amy Lee and Monica McGuigan.

Monica is a Scala developer at JP Morgan, working in a team who aims to improve understanding of the banks' data and data models. She began her programming journey using C#, then onto a mixture C++, JavaScript and TypeScript throughout her undergraduate Physics degree. Monica is also passionate about encouraging those who do not have a Computer Science background into software development roles, as she has been able to apply her transferable problem-solving skills from a scientific discipline to programming and is really enjoying it!
