Meet the Scala Center at Scala Days Madrid!

The Scala Center is an independent, not-for-profit center established at EPFL.


In preparation for the conferences, we’ve asked the Scala Center team what they are most looking forward to and what you can expect to see from them. Here’s what they said:

**What are you most looking forward to at Scala Days this year?**

> *Ever since 2020 we have been missing out on in-person conferences and meetups. Naturally, we miss spending time, exchanging experiences, and hanging out with our fellow Scala enthusiasts. We believe Scala Days will be a great way to reconnect, check-in with our friends, and hear what has been going on over the last coming-up-to four years… We know that we will get inspired, spark new ideas and projects, and hopefully new partnerships will come our way. <br> In short, we are truly looking forward to engaging with the community, receiving feedback on our activities, and establishing new partnerships with motivated companies and individuals to ensure Scala's successful future together.*

**What can attendees expect to see from your company at the conference?**

> *Our whole [team](https://scala.epfl.ch/team.html) will be at the booth! You can see and speak with us, check out what we’ve been up to, and where we stand on our projects. We have a unique position, being a not-for-profit language foundation, that works solely in the community's interest. We want to reach everyone at the conference, especially newcomers, in order to get to get to know each other and understand how we can work together.*
>
> *We invite all the attendees to pass by our booth, we have many super-fun activities, such as:* 
> <ul><li> Talk to us and find out what we do and how you can be involved in our activities; </li>
> <li> Solve a Scala puzzler and enter a raffle to win the "Programming in Scala, 5th edition" book signed by Martin Odersky; </li>
> <li> Get your book signed by Martin after the Scala Center’s  talk, on the 13th of September at lunchtime. You can bring your own book and get it signed for free, or you can get a new copy in place, for a donation to the Scala Center organisation; </li>
> <li> Enjoy a live coding session by Sébastien Doeraene where he will develop a game in Scala.js in real time. </li></ul> 

> *We are on the lookout for new partnerships, both industrial and with motivated individuals! Talk to us during the conference to find out how you can be a part of Scala's success! <br> (also, we will have some chocolate :) )*

**What contribution to the Scala community is your company particularly proud or fond of?**

> *Since 2016 the Scala Center has been involved in major projects, e.g. Coordinating the Scala 3 release, Metals, and the Scala Improvement Process (SIP). Check out our [hall of fame page](https://scala.epfl.ch/hall-of-fame.html) to find out more! 
<br><br> If we had to highlight one specific project, we would choose the release of Scala 3.0.0, from May 2021. Our role was to help coordinate all the teams involved, the wider community of contributors, and communication within the six months leading up to the release itself, and much technical work including tools and documentation to help with migration. For more details on the endeavour, we invite you to check out the “[Scala 3 is here](https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2021/05/14/scala3-is-here.html)” blog post.*

**Is there anything else that you would like to mention?**

> *The Scala Center is looking for new industry partners, see more on [the Scala-lang blog post](https://scala-lang.org/blog/2023/09/11/scala-center-fundraising.html)! By becoming an industry partner, your company can join the Scala Center Advisory Board, receiving a unique opportunity to influence the direction of the Scala Center and Scala itself. You will also get extra visibility by getting your logo featured on the Scala Center frontpage and on our events, and gain access to recruitment opportunities at EPFL.
