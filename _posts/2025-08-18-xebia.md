[Xebia](https://www.xebia.com/) is re-igniting its presence in the Scala community at Scala Days, bringing expertise in Scala, AI, engineering, and data solutions.

Visit their booth to meet the team, explore demos, and pick up some Legos while talking about event-sourced domain modeling and domain-driven design in Scala 3.

Don’t miss their talk, ["Domain modeling for event-sourced data"](/editions/2025/talks/domain-modeling-event-sourced) by César Enrique Ramírez, and hands-on workshop ["Domain Driven Design in Scala 3"](/editions/2025/workshops/ddd-in-scala-3) by David Amancio Gil Méndez, where they’ll share practical insights and approaches that bridge cutting-edge engineering with real-world business needs.

Come meet our Gold Sponsor [Xebia](https://www.xebia.com/) and connect with Juan Pedro Moreno, Francisco Diaz, Aaron Regan, Maureen Elsberry.
