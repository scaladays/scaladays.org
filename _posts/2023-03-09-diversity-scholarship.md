description: At Scala Days, we strive to support the community through offering a scholarship to encourage speaker and attendee diversity at each conference. Applications to the Scala Days Diversity Scholarship are now being accepted.
---

Scala Days is committed to supporting the Scala community through diversifying speaker lineups, conference attendees, and the wider tech community. To continue encouraging such diversity, Scala Days offers scholarships to people from underrepresented groups in tech who wouldnâ€™t otherwise be able to attend and those from low-income backgrounds or countries. 

If you believe you are member of an underrepresented group, we encourage you to apply. It is also important that diversity ticket recipients will not be publicly identified; your information will be kept confidential.

The requirements to apply for the diversity scholarship are: You are at least 18 years of age; You are a member of a group which is underrepresented in tech or from a low-income country and are unable to financially attend; You hold a valid visa for the country in which you are applying for or can fund your own visa; and if you are employed, your employer will not cover the cost of your conference attendance.

Please note that there are a limited number of of scholarships available for each conference and the tickets cannot be sold or transferred. Scala Days team members will review applications on a rolling basis and applicants can be expected to be notified of a decision within 3 weeks of submitting the application.

Most importantly, apply before the deadline! The deadline to apply for the Seattle scholarship is May 5th, 2023. The deadline to apply for the Madrid scholarship is August 11th, 2023.
