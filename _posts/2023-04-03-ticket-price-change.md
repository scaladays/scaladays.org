At Scala Days, we understand that current economic changes have affected community members worldwide. We strive to continue to build the Scala community and in doing so we have decided to lower the overall ticket price for both of this year’s conference editions. To this extent, Scala Days Seattle is offering a special, lower ticket price specifically for individuals purchasing their own tickets. This offer is available for a limited quantity, so grabbing one of the tickets while supplies last is important. The ticket price for Seattle will also remain at the previously stated early bird price of $850. Similarly, the Scala Days Madrid ticket price will remain at the previously stated early bird price of €550 plus tax, €665.50 in total. All workshop prices have also been reduced.

By making the conference more accessible, we hope to unite a diverse range of people and encourage community building. We believe that collaboration and innovation are essential to the long-term success of any business or organization. While reducing ticket prices comes at a cost to Scala Days, we believe it’s a worthwhile investment in our community and the future of the conference itself. We’re excited to see this change's impact and hope it will inspire other companies in our industry to take similar steps.

In conclusion, at Scala Days, we’re committed to understanding the economy and adapting our practices to best serve the community. We hope to encourage community building and bring together a wide range of people by reducing ticket prices for the upcoming conference editions. We believe this is an essential investment in the future of Scala Days and the success of the Scala community.
