We are ecstatic to announce that ScalaBridge will take place in Lausanne before the Scala Days opening keynote on August 19th.

ScalaBridge is a completely free event to attend with the goal of supporting new members of the Scala community and improving diversity within the wider programming community. This inclusive event is hosted and supported by community leaders from throughout the Scala community, who spend the day mentoring those who join and answering their questions. This is a chance to get involved in some hands-on learning within a fun and supportive community.

The hosts of this ScalaBridge edition are Amy Lee and Monica McGuigan.
