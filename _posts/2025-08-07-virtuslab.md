description: Meet the Scala Days 2025 Sponsor - VirtusLab!
---
Scala language and tooling has evolved thanks to the continuous contributions from the community, academy and industry. VirtusLab is a company that has played a major role in that evolution.

[VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com/) has been part of the Scala ecosystem for over 15 years. They are the company behind Scala, and they contributed directly to the language’s development and key tools like Metals. At their booth, they’ll be sharing how to improve developer productivity based on their 12+ years of experience and LLM-assisted workflows. Since they’ve joined forces with SoftwareMill, you can also chat with them about libraries like Tapir, STTP, or ox, talk to them, and a must-see are their live coding sessions.

Do not miss their talks:
- ["From Imports to Targets: Bazel on Autopilot with Scala Gazelle"](/editions/2025/talks/scala-meets-genai-build-the) by Wojciech Mazur
- ["Scala, Productivity, and AI"](/editions/2025/talks/scala-productivity-and-ai) by Krzysztof Romanowski

They are also offering a [round-table event](https://lp.virtuslab.com/events/roundtable-ai-lausanne/) to discuss how AI is shaping software industry.
