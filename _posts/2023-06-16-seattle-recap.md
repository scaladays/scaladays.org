Scala Days Seattle was met with perfect weather, spectacular views, great food, and even better company! The conference was completed with a workshop hosted by [Xebia Functional](https://twitter.com/XebiaFunctional), a [Scala Spree](https://scaladays.org/seattle-2023/scala-spree), 20+ talk presentations, hands-on sponsors, and an enthusiastic community of Scala aficionados.

Scala Days Seattle began with an opening keynote, an exclusive meetup cohosted by Xebia Functional and Databricks, and a reception. At the meetup, [Raúl Raja](https://twitter.com/raulraja) unveiled [xef.ai](https://xef.ai/) and [Denny Lee](https://twitter.com/dennylee) introduced Dolly by [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/). The keynote presentations by [Paweł Marks](https://scaladays.org/seattle-2023/keynote-state-of-scala), [Daniel Spiewak](https://scaladays.org/seattle-2023/micro-optimization-for-fun-and-profit), and [Denny Lee and Ginger Holt](https://scaladays.org/seattle-2023/use-spark-from-anywhere-a-spark-client-in-scala-powered-by-spark-connect) were thought-provoking and gave incredible insights on the present and future of Scala. All of the Seattle presentations shared various topics around Scala, including new projects, ongoing projects, how to teach Scala, and what Scala can teach you. 


Along with the presentations, everyone in attendance enjoyed the amazing views of Mt. Rainier and Pier 66 that the Bell Harbor International Conference Center has to offer, as well as great meals and even better networking opportunities throughout the three conference days.
