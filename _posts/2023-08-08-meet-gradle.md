Meet Gradle, a Gold sponsor at Scala Days Madrid!

Gradle Enterprise uses data analytics and acceleration technologies to speed up and make the critical software development processes, from builds to testing to CI more efficient. It is a key enabling technology for the emerging and transformative discipline of Developer Productivity Engineering.

In preparation for the conferences, we’ve asked the Gradle team what they are most looking forward to and what you can expect to see from them. Here’s what they said:

**What are you most looking forward to at Scala Days this year?**

> *Meeting the Scala community and learning more from them about the sorts of problems they face when it comes to developer productivity.*

**What can attendees expect to see from your company at the conference?**

> *Come over to our booth to see Build Scan® for sbt in action, and watch our technical talk "X-Ray your Build: Build Events, Build Scans, and Caching Explained" on Wednesday 13th to learn more about the technical challenges in building such a tool*

**What contribution to the Scala community is your company particularly proud or fond of?**

> *The Gradle Enterprise strategy is to support all important build systems and language ecosystems to maximize developer productivity. The release of sbt support for the Gradle Enterprise Build Scan is an important step in that direction. Gradle Enterprise already supports Gradle Build Tool, Apache Maven, and Bazel, it’s great to welcome sbt to that family. Gradle Inc. is committed to the continued development of Triplequote Hydra, the world’s only parallel compiler for the Scala language.*

**Is there anything else that you would like to mention?**

> *Come by the booth and meet us! We'd love to talk to you! We also have copies of the book “Getting to Know IntelliJ IDEA”, by our developer advocate Trisha Gee, to give away for free!*
