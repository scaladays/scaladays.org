<br>

In preparation for the conferences, weâ€™ve asked the folks at Signify what they are most looking forward to and what you can expect to see from them.
<br>

**What are you most looking forward to at Scala Days this year?**
<br>

> *We're thrilled for the return of Scala Days after 3 years hiatus, and the opportunity to be part of the event in Seattle! At Signify, we're excited about the networking opportunities, learning from industry experts, and meeting attendees in person. The speaker line-up is outstanding, promising some very insightful talks.*

<br>

**What can attendees expect to see from your company at the conference?**
<br>

> *During the conference, attendees can expect to learn about Signify's role as a dedicated Scala global staffing partner. We specialize in connecting engineers and developers with their dream Scala roles. Our approach is simple: we understand your needs and match you with the best opportunities that unleash your full potential. You can meet our team at Scala Days, discuss career opportunities, and grab some cool swag. We also have exciting prizes to give away, so don't forget to come and say hi for a chance to win.*

<br>

**What contribution to the Scala community is your company particularly proud or fond of?**
<br>

> *One contribution we're particularly proud of is our support for the Scala community. In addition to sponsoring Scala Days, we organize monthly meetups called Scala in the City (currently in London, coming soon to the USA) and collaborate with clients to provide specialized Scala workshops, focusing on education and upskilling their tech teams.*

<br>

**Is there anything else that you would like to mention?**
<br>

> *As platinum sponsors of Scala Days, we're honored and excited to engage with the community face-to-face. The conference promises a packed schedule of networking, insights, inspiration, and all things Scala.*
