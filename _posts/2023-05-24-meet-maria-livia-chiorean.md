Maria Livia Chiorean started her career in 2015 at the Guardian as a Software Engineer, and that is when she started learning Scala and functional programming. It’s been many years since, and after a short stop at Sky, Maria found her dream team at Expedia, where she has been for the last 3 years. The last 6 months have been challenging as she has transitioned into an Engineering Manager role. Maria loves traveling, photography, and dancing the Argentine Tango in her free time.
<br>

At Scala Days Seattle, she will present the talk “From Managing Scala to Managing People.” During this talk, Maria will touch on a few topics such as why she decided to move to management, how writing Scala part-time is different from full-time, how does Scala look like from a management perspective, how you keep up with what is new, and what Scala has taught her about management. Overall, it’ll be about the things Maria wishes she knew before, and the things she learned after.

<br>
We asked Maria some questions about what he’s looking forward to and what you can take away from her presentation: <br>

**What are you most looking forward to at Scala Days this year?** <br>

> *I'm excited to attend my first in-person conference in almost 4 years! There are so many exciting talks lined up, looking forward to learning from everyone's experience. I'm also hoping to connect with many people, so come say hi!*

<br>
**What can attendees expect to learn during your talk session?** <br>

> *I want people to understand the importance of choosing the managing track and how it can help shape the next generation of Scala developers. If you are unsure this path is for you come to my talk and let's discuss about it. Alternatively, if you are new to management I'd love to hear how your are doing so far, let's connect afterwards!*

<br>
**What is a contribution to the Scala community that you are particularly proud or fond of?** <br>

> *A few years ago I helped organise a functional programming conference called LambdAle in London. It was a great learning experience and my favourite part was creating a space for so many talented engineers to get together and discuss ideas.*
