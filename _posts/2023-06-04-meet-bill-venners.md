We asked Bill some questions about what he’s looking forward to and what you can take away from his presentation: 

**What are you most looking forward to at Scala Days this year?**

> *I am most looking forward to getting together with actual humans, as this will be my first in-person conference since the pandemic. I am really happy to see conferences starting up again, because interacting with people in the community was always what I enjoyed most about Scala.*


**What can attendees expect to learn during your talk session?**

> *My talk will be about how machine learning and AI can help us solve problems, including how to become more productive at programming.*
