In preparation for the conferences, weâ€™ve asked ScalaJobs what they are most looking forward to and what you can expect to see from them. Look at what they had to say:
<br>

**What are you most looking forward to at Scala Days this year?**
<br>

> *I am excited to meet people from the Scala community and see what cool stuff they are building!*

<br>

**What can attendees expect to see from your company at the conference?**
<br>

> *To have a chat with the only Scala recruiters who are also Scala developers! We know the market better than anyone and we are happy to share our insights with you.*

<br>

**What contribution to the Scala community is your company particularly proud or fond of?**
<br>

> *It is difficult to land a first tech job that's why we offer free Scala training courses to all junior developers applying through our platform. We also sponsor independent content producers such as Dev Inside You.*

<br>

**Is there anything else that you would like to mention?**
<br>

> *Please don't hesitate to come have a chat with us, you can recognize us by our ScalaJobs.com t-shirts.*
