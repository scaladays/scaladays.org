We are excited to introduce Kalix by Lightbend, a Silver sponsor for Scala Days Seattle and Madrid!

[Kalix]( https://www.kalix.io/) (@Kalix.io), by Lightbend, is a Platform as a service that enables organizations to build and deploy cloud-native microservices and APIs rapidly and at the lowest possible cost. It provides an “out of the box” cloud native stack that delivers a 200% increase in developer velocity with minimal operations required. Kalix is a dramatic advancement over the existing serverless model in abstracting complexity, as it provides a unifying application layer that pulls together the necessary pieces—including databases, message brokers, caches, services meshes, API gateways, blob storages, CDN networks, CI/CD products, etc.—and exposes them into one single unified programming model and DX tailored for the cloud and edge. By abstracting away the complexity of the backend, teams can focus solely on building the business logic behind your apps, and any developer can code highly performant and scalable distributed systems to modernize and transform your business. With Kalix, Lightbend now offers a choice of solutions in support of organizations' most business-critical initiatives.

In preparation for Scala Days, we’ve asked the Kalix team what they are excited about and what you can expect from them at the conference. Take a look:  

**What are you most looking forward to at Scala Days this year?**

*The interaction and discussions with the Scala community.*

**What can attendees expect to see from your company at the conference?**

*Hear about the new feature set that is moving Akka another big leap forward toward the Edge.*

**What contribution to the Scala community is your company particularly proud or fond of?**

*Commercial-grade Scala compiler & Akka.*

**Is there anything else that you would like to mention?**

*Same as the first question, we are looking forward to the interaction and discussions with the Scala community.*
