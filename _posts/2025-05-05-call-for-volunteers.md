Every edition of Scala Days is made possible by its organizing team, but each year we look to the Scala community for volunteers who provide an extra special addition to the team. This year is no different. 

The Call for Volunteers is officially open! 

The Scala Days organizing team is looking for volunteers who are committed, reliable, kind, and enthusiastic to join us in making the whole event memorable for each and every person who walks through our doors.

In order to become a volunteer, please fill out the form linked below. Each application will be reviewed and responded to at the end of our call for volunteers. 

The application will close on **Wednesday, June 25 at 23:59 GMT**.
