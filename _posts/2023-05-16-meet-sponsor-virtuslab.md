Meet VirtusLab, a Gold sponsor at Scala Days Seattle and Madrid!

VirtusLab’s roots were built on Scala, 13 years ago, resulting in becoming the leading developing partner of core components within the Scala ecosystem, including Scala 3, Metals, and Scala CLI. After joining forces with SoftwareMill, both companies amplified their capacity to deliver efficiency for their clients as the VirtusLab Group. 500+ dedicated professionals take up any challenge to spark growth for our clients’ businesses.

VirtusLab provides advice, knowledge, as well as gradual and complete solutions in Data/AI, Cloud native, UX/UI, developer experience and tooling. Since VirtusLab nurtures talent vividly, they also have a significant sense of community. Driving innovation, especially within the Scala ecosystem, they foster knowledge sharing and mutual growth. This is also their mission for the upcoming Scala Days 2023.

In preparation for the conferences, we’ve asked VirtusLab what they are most looking forward to and what you can expect to see from them.

**What are you most looking forward to at Scala Days this year?**

> *This year, we are thrilled to be part of Scala Days, one of the most anticipated events in the Scala community. After an extended hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we are eager to reconnect with the community. Our primary goal is to listen, understand, and address the problems that both open-source and business/industry projects face. We are keen to discuss potential solutions and ways we can help drive the Scala ecosystem forward.*

**What can attendees expect to see from your company at the conference?**

> *At Scala Days, VirtusLab will be presenting the future of the Scala language and its ecosystem. We see this conference as an opportunity to engage in dialogues that inspire the Scala community. We are prepared to listen to your concerns, understand the frictions you face, and provide insightful advice to help you navigate these challenges.*

**What contribution to the Scala community is your company particularly proud or fond of?**

> *Our contribution to the Scala community is something we take immense pride in. Among many initiatives, our work on the open community build of Scala 3 stands out, as we've made significant strides in enhancing its stability culminating in the first LTS release of Scala 3. We are also proud of our efforts to make Scala more accessible to beginners. Our development of the Scala CLI and Scala Toolkit is a testament to this commitment, as these tools significantly lower the entry barrier for newcomers to Scala.*

**Is there anything else that you would like to mention?**

> *In conclusion, VirtusLab is more than just a software house, we care about the community organization and we are committed to propelling Scala's future. We invite you to join us at Scala Days to collaborate, learn, and inspire one another. <br> Together, we can shape the future of Scala!*
