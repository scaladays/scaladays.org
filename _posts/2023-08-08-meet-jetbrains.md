In preparation for the conferences, we’ve asked the JetBrains team what they are most looking forward to and what you can expect to see from them. Here’s what they said:

**What are you most looking forward to at Scala Days this year?**

> *We’re happy to be able to reconnect with the Scala community after a long COVID-induced hiatus. A lot has changed over the last few years, and we want to talk to people about it in real life, face to face: hear their thoughts, get feedback, share our plans for the future, and learn about theirs. We’re also looking forward to the Tooling Summit. The first one, back in March, was very fruitful and we have high hopes for this one, too.*

**What can attendees expect to see from your company at the conference?**

> *There will be a talk about the Scala plugin. We encourage everyone to attend it and hopefully learn something new. We’ll also have a booth where you’ll be able to meet members of the Scala plugin team and ask any questions you may have, which we'll try to answer to the best of our abilities. We’ll also be hosting a quiz and giving out Scala plugin swag, too, so don’t be a stranger and be sure to drop by!*

**What contribution to the Scala community is your company particularly proud or fond of?**

> *The Scala plugin. An IDE is one of the most important tools for a software developer, second maybe only to the compiler. IntelliJ IDEA with the Scala plugin is the most popular Scala IDE today. It has had a huge impact on the Scala language and its ecosystem and has contributed to the popularity and adoption of Scala, particularly in corporate projects.*
