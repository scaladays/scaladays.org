A special meetup co-hosted by Databricks and Xebia will be taking place at Scala Days Seattle on June 5th at 18:00 at the Bell Harbor International Conference Center and followed by (great) food, drinks, and networking. 


Join **Unleashing the Developer's Arsenal: Harnessing the Power of AI and LLM** for a free evening of new presentations, great food, and networking opportunities.

One of the featured presentations is titled **Why Dolly is just the beginning for open LLM models**: Dolly is just the Start. <br> Brought to the forefront with Open AI’s ChatGPT, we will start with a primer on the purpose and importance of large language models or LLMs in this session.  We will also discuss the historical context of building ever larger generalized LLM models. Within this context, we showcase and demonstrate Dolly 1.0: initially democratizing the magic of ChatGPT with open models and then Dolly 2.0 - the world's first truly open instruction-tuned LLM.  Dolly is a proof of concept that showcases LLMs could be tuned for <$100 and with much smaller amounts of data than previously thought (Dolly utilizes an open-source commercially available 15K dataset).  <br> But Dolly is just the beginning for open LLM models - there are many other great open models, such as Hugging Face’s Open Assistant and Mosaic MPT.  Proprietary models like Open AI’s GPT 4.0 are extremely powerful and certainly have an important place in your LLM toolbox.  But you can also fine-tune smaller open models on your own data such that your data is your competitive advantage - i.e., your data is your IP.


The other presentation will be presented by Xebia Functional's CTO, [Raul Raja](https://twitter.com/raulraja) and is titled **Integrating AI Workflows into your Project: Introducing Xef.ai**. <br> This talk will introduce the new Xef.ai library, how it works, and how it allows developers of all skill levels to introduce AI into their programs. <br> Xef is a multiplatform library initially available for Scala and Kotlin and with ongoing development and plans to support many more languages. <br> The Xef library provides a set of primitives for integrating AI workflows into projects. Developed by Xebia Functional's research and open-source team, this library draws inspiration from the low-level architecture of `langchain` from Python and the functional and error-handling DSLs provided by Kotlin's arrow-kt.io library. The Xef library furthers this approach with the `ai` DSL, which treats AI workflows as pure functional values. These functional values track the effects and errors the AI can produce alongside its regular output predictions statically. Interacting with an AI using precise types and pure values makes it easy to reason about the behavior of the AI program and to compose AI workflows with other software components predictably and reliably.


Check-in for the meetup will take place between 17:30 and the start of the meetup at 18:00. 


Now for the most important details: **the FOOD**! <br> The menu is not just your usual pizza and beer. The food served will be an assortment of hors d'oeuvres. There will be meat, seafood, vegetarian, and vegan options available. Not to mention, a selection of various beverages including beer, wine, a signature cocktail, and non-alcoholic options. <br> *The menu is subject to change.*
