In preparation for the conferences, we’ve asked Databricks what they are most looking forward to and what you can expect to see from them. Here’s what they said:

**What are you most looking forward to at Scala Days this year?**

> *Meeting and having discussions with the Scala community!  This is easily the best and most important part of the conference!*

**What can attendees expect to see from your company at the conference?**

> *You'll hear about Spark as you can normally expect, but we're also talking about LLMs and have a joint meetup with Scala Days organizers - so make sure to come!*

**What contribution to the Scala community is your company particularly proud or fond of?**

> *In addition to the Spark ecosystem, which is built on the foundation of the Scala community, we're particularly fond of the [com.lihaoyi Ecosystem](https://scaladays.org/seattle-2023/the-making-of-the-com-lihaoyi-ecosystem) by no other than Haoyi Li!*

**Is there anything else that you would like to mention?**

> *Join us at the [Unleashing the Developer’s Arsenal meetup](https://scaladays.org/seattle-2023/meetup) right before the [Welcome Reception](https://scaladays.org/seattle-2023/schedule) as a great way to kick off festivities.*
