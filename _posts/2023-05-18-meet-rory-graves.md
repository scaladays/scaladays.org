Rory Graves is a builder of tools and a fighter of complexity who strives for beauty in code. Having built software at every scale, from tiny phones to internet-scale data processing pipelines, he is always interested in new challenges.

At Scala Days Seattle he will present the talk [“Building Billion Node Graphs for Machine Learning,”]( https://scaladays.org/seattle-2023/building-billion-node-graphs-for-machine-learning) exploring experiences of working with graphs at a large scale. The talk will cover multiple aspects such as defining graphs, transforming and injecting raw data into graphs, executing graph ML algorithms at scale, and making the graph scalable.

<br>
We asked Rory some questions about what he’s looking forward to and what you can take away from his presentation: <br>

**What are you most looking forward to at Scala Days this year?** <br>

> *This year’s lineup looks amazing, so many great speakers, contributors, and friends all in one place.   I love the energy of putting all of these amazing people in the same space and watching the magic happen.*

<br>
**What can attendees expect to learn during your talk session?** <br>

> *In the last year, my role has changed, I have moved from focusing on pure software engineering to supporting ML researchers to perform cutting-edge research.   Enabling them to explore further and faster by solving some interesting and hard engineering problems when working with global-scale data.    You will hear about my experiences and thoughts on building software for research rather than normal product engineering.  I will explore this through the lens of a particular project - graph machine learning using and creating and manipulating petabytes of data, building huge graphs, and using those to execute graph algorithms.*

<br>
**What is a contribution to the Scala community that you are particularly proud or fond of?** <br>

> *One of my proudest achievements in the Scala community is working with some colleagues to significantly improve the collections and compiler performance.  It was a team effort that made a big and noticeable difference to the tools we all use.  A second recent one was [this tweet](https://twitter.com/diesalbla/status/1618360576610308097) – feeling like you are making a difference to people.*
