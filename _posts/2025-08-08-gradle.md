description: Meet the Scala Days 2025 Sponsor - Gradle!
---

Fast feedback loops are key to productive Scala development, and build performance plays a big part in that.

[Develocity](https://gradle.com/develocity/solutions/sbt/) by [Gradle](https://gradle.com/) gives sbt users powerful ways to speed up builds, shorten feedback cycles, and gain deep insights into build performance. It also supports the Scala Center’s OSS instance, helping the community improve build efficiency at scale.

At Scala Days, the Gradle team will show how Develocity can help you observe, optimize, and accelerate your builds and tests.

Do not miss their talk, ["Exploring Build Caching: A Practical Overview"](/editions/2025/talks/exploring-build-caching-a-practical) by Martin Duhem.

Come meet our Platinum Sponsor Gradle at their booth and connect with Hans Dockter, Gradle’s founder and CEO.
