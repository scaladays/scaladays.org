There are many great opportunities when you sponsor Scala Days this year. Make great connections with Scala experts and enthusiasts as we expect 500 attendees in Seattle, WA, USA and 600 attendees in Madrid, Spain.

At Scala Days leaders of community groups, students, and contributing developers from around the globe come together to share their experience with one another. These Scala aficionados share new ideas about creating applications with Scala and related technologies such as Akka, Kafka, as well as Spark.

Surrounding the Scala Days Seattle and Madrid conferences you can also expect satellite events like Scala Spree, ScalaBridge, training workshops, and contributors summits.
