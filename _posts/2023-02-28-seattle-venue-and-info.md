## About Seattle

Seattle is a city in Washington State, in the American Pacific Northwest region. The city, also called the Emerald City, is located on the Puget Sound and is surrounded by water, evergreen forests, mountains, and thousands of acres of parkland. Seattle is also home to technology giants Microsoft and Amazon, coffee leader Starbucks, and the origin of grunge music. Local sports teams include the Seattle Seahawks, Seattle Sounders FC, Seattle Supersonics, Seattle Mariners, and the University of Washington Huskies. The city’s futuristic Space Needle is Seattle’s most iconic landmark, from the 1962 World Fair.

This city has great restaurants, things to do, and places to see. Some of the most famous areas in Seattle include the Ballard District, Pioneer Square, Belltown Neighborhood, and Puget Sound.

June is a beautiful time of year to visit Seattle. The weather will be moderate with average highs of 24°C (75°F) and lows of 11°C (50°F). Rain is likely so it is important to bring a jacket. Most days will be cloudy or overcast at one point or another.
