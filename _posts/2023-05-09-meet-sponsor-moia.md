We are excited to introduce MOIA, a Silver sponsor for Scala Days Madrid!

MOIA is the young mobility company of the Volkswagen Group. Since its launch in December 2016, MOIA has been pursuing the goal of redefining the mobility of people in urban areas. To this end, MOIA works closely with cities, public transport operators and private mobility partners. The focus of MOIA is on offering all-electric on-demand ridepooling - a convenient, affordable, and environmentally friendly alternative to the private car. From algorithms and apps to electric vehicles, fleet management and charging infrastructure, MOIA has a holistic approach when it comes to ridepooling

In preparation for the conferences, weâ€™ve asked the folks at MOIA what they are most looking forward to and what you can expect to see from them.

**What are you most looking forward to at Scala Days this year?**

> *We are eagerly anticipating the opportunity to reconnect with the vibrant Scala community in person, finally stepping away from the virtual confines imposed by the pandemic. There's something truly special about meeting familiar faces and forging new connections after such a prolonged period of online-only events.*

**What can attendees expect to see from your company at the conference?**

> *At the conference, attendees can look forward to meeting our team of 15 joyful individuals who are excited to engage with them and provide insightful answers to any questions about working at MOIA and our ambitious journey towards achieving autonomous ridepooling across Europe. We are committed to creating a positive and interactive experience for everyone.*

**What contribution to the Scala community is your company particularly proud or fond of?**

> *We are particularly proud of our various open-source libraries, including Scynamo. This library offers typeclasses to facilitate the conversion of data for usage with AWS DynamoDB. Additionally, our colleagues have made significant contributions to numerous projects, such as Cats, ZIO, Scapegoat, and more. We value our role in supporting and enhancing the Scala community.*

**Is there anything else that you would like to mention?**

> *In addition to our contributions, we are proud to sponsor the work on ScalaPB, an essential piece of the Scala open-source ecosystem. Furthermore, we regularly host Scala meetups at our Hamburg and Berlin offices, providing a platform for Scala enthusiasts to come together, share knowledge, and foster collaboration.*
