We are excited to introduce Codelounge, Software Institute (USI, Lugano), a Bronze sponsor for Scala Days Seattle!

CodeLounge is the center for software research & development (R&D), part of the [Software Institute](http://si.usi.ch/) – [USI, Lugano](https://www.usi.ch/en). CodeLounge brings together expertise from academia and industry, with two main goals: (1) push research ideas beyond prototypes, making real products out of them, and (2) carry out applied research in the areas of software development, visualization, evolution, and analytics. The encapsulation of CodeLounge within the Software Institute enables collaborating closely with research groups and fostering interdisciplinary projects.
