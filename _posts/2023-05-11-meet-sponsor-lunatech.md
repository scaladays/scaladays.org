In preparation for the conferences, weâ€™ve asked Lunatech what they are most looking forward to and what you can expect to see from them.

**What are you most looking forward to at Scala Days this year?**

> *Like the many years that we've been a part of Scala Days, we always look forward to connecting with the community around Scala. Especially since this is the first Scala Days after Covid. While we often connect with people online, there's nothing like seeing people in real life, having a good chat, and catching up!*

**What can attendees expect to see from your company at the conference?**

> *We'll have a couple speakers talking about some of the work we do around supporting the Scala Center and tooling. Giving back to the community is something we're passionate about, so please do ask us about this!*

**What contribution to the Scala community is your company particularly proud or fond of?**

> *Over the last couple years, we've been able to give a helping hand with a couple different projects that we've been proud of. We've given some developer time to help out with the development of Metals and more recently we've given developer time directly to the Scala Center to help with the maintenance and development of various tools. Another example we're proud of is re-igniting some work around scoverage, which eventually led to it being supported right inside of the Scala 3 compiler.*
