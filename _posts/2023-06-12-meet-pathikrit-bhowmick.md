Pathikrit serves as the Director of Engineering at Coatue Management, a hedge fund located in New York City. He has been a member of the Scala Platform Process and has been writing Scala for 5+ years. Pathikrit has authored some popularly used Scala libraries like better-files and metarest.

He has been a speaker at numerous Scala conferences, including Scala Days and SBTB. Pathikrit is passionate about bringing functional programming paradigms to domains such as machine learning and databases.
<br>

At Scala Days Seattle, he will present the talk “Full Stack Scala Web Application.” In this talk, Pathikrit will write a simple full-stack by using simple, vanilla Scala.

<br>

We asked Pathikrit some questions about what he’s looking forward to and what you can take away from his presentation: 
<br>

**What are you most looking forward to at Scala Days this year?** 
<br>

> *Meeting Scala enthusiasts in person – I used to attend Scala conferences pre-Covid but this would be my first one in 3+ years.*

<br>

**What can attendees expect to learn during your talk session?** 
<br>

> *Write a quick full-stack Scala web app. Super useful for personal projects or as a "admin panel" for your existing Scala projects.*

<br>

**What is a contribution to the Scala community that you are particularly proud or fond of?** 
<br>

> *I started the Scala library better-files. I heard people like it. I also contributed ArrayDeque to Scala 2.13 and rewrote Stacks, Queues using it making them much faster in Scala 2.13.*
