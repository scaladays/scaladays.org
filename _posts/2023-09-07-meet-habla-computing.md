In preparation for the conferences, we’ve asked the Habla Computing team what they are most looking forward to and what you can expect to see from them. Here’s what they said:

**What are you most looking forward to at Scala Days this year?**

> *We are excited about the opportunity to meet and learn from fellow enthusiasts!*

**What can attendees expect to see from your company at the conference?**

> *At the conference, we will be offering specialized training on DSL design using Scala 3. We thoroughly enjoyed preparing for this session and hope that attendees will find it equally enjoyable and informative!*

**What contribution to the Scala community is your company particularly proud or fond of?**

> *We take pride in our decade-long involvement in founding and managing the Madrid Scala Meetup group. Additionally, we're thrilled about our latest open-source project, [doric](https://github.com/hablapps/doric), designed to enhance the experience of programming with Spark SQL in Scala.*

> **Is there anything else that you would like to mention?**

> *Please feel free to drop by and say hi at Scala Days!*
