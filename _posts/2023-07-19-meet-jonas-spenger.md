Jonas Spenger is a PhD Student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology / RISE Research Institutes of Sweden in Stockholm, Sweden. His main interests are the design and implementation of distributed systems. He is one of the core members of the Portals Project. Previously, Jonas worked on various research projects in the Berlin area, where he also received his BSc and MSc in computer science at HU Berlin.

<br>

At Scala Days Madrid, he will present the talk “Crossing the Boundaries of Stateful Streaming and Actors Using Serverless Portals.” This talk will provide an overview of the Portals model, demo several examples, including a fault-tolerant actor model, and present the open-source implementation and project, inviting contributions from the Scala community.!

<br>

We asked Jonas a couple of questions about what he’s looking forward to and what you can take away from his presentation: 

<br>

**What are you most looking forward to at Scala Days this year?** 
<br>

> *I'm excited to learn about new projects in the Scala ecosystem and meet with fellow Scala enthusiasts. There are many great talks on concurrency and actors that I am looking forward to.*

<br>

**What can attendees expect to learn during your talk session?**
<br>

> *We'll present our work on the Portals Project, which is a framework for writing and executing stateful serverless applications. At its core, it is a unification of stateful dataflow streaming (Flink, Kafka, etc.) and the actor model (Akka, Erlang, etc.). We'll show how these programming models interact through a new abstraction called Portal or Portal Service. The Portal service enables exposing dataflows as services with an actor-like communication model. The talk will provide an overview of the Portals model, demo several examples, including a fault-tolerant actor library, and present the open-source implementation and project, inviting contributions from the Scala community.*
