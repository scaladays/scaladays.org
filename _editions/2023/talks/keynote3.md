Building 21 million lines of Scala and Java code on a clean machine in less than 2 minutes: can it be done? Yes!

The Optimus Cirrus platform is capable of automatically caching and parallelizing tasks across thousands of compute nodes comprising over a petabyte of RAM, and is used in production every day to support a significant part of Morgan Stanley's business. The platform also underpins its own build tool which is responsible for well-scoped, cacheable compilation in a distributed environment while keeping its developers happy and productive.

In this talk we'll show you how Optimus Cirrus derives its power from its foundations in Scala and functional programming principles. We'll demonstrate how its build tool reduced our compile times from over 1 hour down to as little as a few seconds, and discuss compelling technical challenges we encountered that are interesting to any developer creating applications that need to perform well.
