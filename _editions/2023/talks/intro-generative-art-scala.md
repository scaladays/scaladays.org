Sometimes we need to just take a step back from what we normally do with Scala and explore something fun. In this talk we'll use Scala and Processing to dip our toes into generative art via flow fields. We'll also take a look at what a minimal, flexible workflow for this is by live-coding some examples using scala-cli.
