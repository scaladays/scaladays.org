Let’s discuss how we can continue to grow and improve the Scala community, creating a welcoming and innovative environment for future Scala developers. As community leaders, how can we best welcome newcomers to the Scala community at the entrance of the pipeline, setting up a pipeline for a diverse community as we move into the future?

This discussion will provide a brief status update on the current state of the community, including post-pandemic fragmentation and technical instability stemming from the Scala 3 migration. We’ll look into how the community has changed in the recent past if people have left and why, as well as who’s coming into the community and what motivates them to get involved. Throughout this discussion, we will examine other communities and what they do to entice new members and encourage involvement. Lastly, let’s look at grassroots initiatives, safeguarding initiatives, and how community leaders can encourage new community members to participate in meetups or projects.
