This presentation addresses the common issue of forgetting to close resources such as files or HTTP clients, and the resulting challenges when faced with exceptions or interruptions during processing. 

I will present Resource, a solution from the [cats-effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} library that provides an elegant way to address this problem. We will go through various use cases demonstrating its key characteristics including error handling and composing multiple Resources together. Attendees will also learn about unconventional use cases, such as consuming elements from a queue and transforming Resources to a Stream.
