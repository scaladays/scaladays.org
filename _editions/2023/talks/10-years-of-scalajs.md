In February 2023, we celebrated the 10-year anniversary of Scala.js. When it started, compiling Scala to JavaScript was a dream. Today, it has become everyday reality. Scala.js is a mature technology with a rock-solid core, a vibrant ecosystem of dedicated libraries, and an enthusiastic community of users and contributors.

In this talk, we look back at the early days of Scala.js, how it started, and what were the key design decisions. We then explore some of the most important elements of its success, and where they led us. Finally, we take a glimpse at the future and where we are going.
