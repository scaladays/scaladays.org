Christmas is at stake! The Elves have run into problems (again!) and it is your job to help them and save Christmas. How? By using your Scala programming skills! I'll explain why Scala is a good fit and give you competing advantage when participating in the Advent of Code.

By discussing my solutions for several problems from Advent of Code 2022 I will touch on the following subjects:
* Introduction of Advent of Code
* Why Advent of Code is good for learning Scala
* Parsing problem input files
* Scala collections library
* Why Scala is a good fit for solving Advent of Code puzzles
* Functional vs. imperative style
* Mutable vs. immutable data structures
* Common pitfalls
