This talk covers the new features in IntelliJ Scala Plugin. Learn about new inspections and quick-fixes, type inference hints, and other functionalities we've added to make programming in IntelliJ IDEA more efficient and enjoyable for Scala developers.

The Scala plugin has seen a lot of improvements over the last few years. New features have been added. Bugs have been fixed. On top of that, how developers use IntelliJ IDEA and the Scala plugin has changed in many ways, just as has the profile of our average customer.

Our surveys now indicate that most of the Scala plugin's users are not aware of many of its new features, or if they are, they don't realize their full potential. In this session, we will explore some of the most exciting and sometimes overlooked features that we have worked on in the last few years. We will discuss how best to use them and how they can improve your productivity without being too much of a mental burden.
