This talk is for those who are interested to uncover mysteries of the anomalies that happen with the data pipelines in production, to learn about the approaches to fixing those issues and preventing them in the future.

Knowledge about various tech tools and hands-on experience is essential. But there's something that is hard to get from books and courses: experience running production applications. With real data that can have anomalies or changes over time the experience of using a specific tech stack becomes completely different. Having an ideal image of how the system should work might not help when something goes wrong.

In this talk, you will learn how to deal with various production issues like data evolution, anomalies, fixing errors in past data, dealing with real-time data, and more. With the fuel of the pipelines being the data from advertising campaigns in AdTech.
