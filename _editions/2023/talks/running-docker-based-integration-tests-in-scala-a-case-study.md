When it comes to running integration tests for Scala applications, Docker containers can be a useful tool for mocking infrastructural dependencies. In this talk, we will compare two alternatives for running Docker-based integration tests in Scala: sbt-docker-compose and testcontainers-scala.

We'll share lessons learned from our own experience using these tools for integration testing in production-ready Scala applications. We'll discuss the trade-offs involved in choosing between sbt-docker-compose and testcontainers-scala, with a focus on execution time and test design.

Whether you're a seasoned Scala developer or just getting started with integration testing in Docker, this presentation will provide you with valuable insights and practical tips to improve your testing workflow.
