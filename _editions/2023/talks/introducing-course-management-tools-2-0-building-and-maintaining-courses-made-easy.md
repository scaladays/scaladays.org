“To teach is to learn twice” - Joseph Joubert

Creating a course to teach a programming language, framework or other piece of technology is a rewarding endeavor. Simplifying something to the point it can be understood by newcomers requires our own understanding to be both broad and deep. Simply put, teaching a thing is an excellent way to really understand a thing. 

Over the years we've created many courses. Creating a series of exercises as problems for students to solve, each building upon the last, leading to a working implementation of some use-case.

Creating courses requires a huge investment of time and energy. Maintaining courses - to keep up-to-date with the latest version, ensuring it covers all the features - requires even more effort.

This talk introduces you to the Course Management Tools (CMT) - tooling we've created to make the lives of both the course creator and the student much easier. 

You're probably wondering:
- How can I quickly get started building courses?
- Why can't I just use Git?
- How can I allow students to save their work during a course?
- How can I get feedback from students to improve my course?
- Framework X has just introduced a new feature, how can I insert a new exercise without screwing everything up?
- How can I distribute my course to students?
- How can students get the latest version of my course?

We‚'ll answer all these questions, and more!
