Mill is a Scala build tool that offers an alternative to the venerable SBT toolchain. This talk will explore how Mill combines the power of functional programming, together with the flexibility of the Scala language, and decades of best practices taken from established build tool ecosystems like SBT and Bazel. We will see how this unique combination results is a Scala build tool that is faster, easier to use, and overall far more intuitive than SBT or any other build tool on the market.
