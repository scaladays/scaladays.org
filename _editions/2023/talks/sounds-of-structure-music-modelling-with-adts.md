Can you make music with Scala? The answer is yes, and I’ll show you how. As a former professional musician now re-purposed as a Scala developer, I have used functional programming fundamentals to model music and create a simple music sequencer.

The presentation will walk through how and why I made modelling decisions to represent musical properties and events, and I’ll construct and play a song from scratch using single-note samples of my voice.

The talk is aimed at Scala and FP beginners and/or any fans of digital music creation and production and is designed as a fun introduction to ADT usage in modelling real-life data.

*Topics covered:*
* How I have chosen to model musical elements and properties.
* How algebraic data types and structural recursion have been used to create a simple idiomatic music DSL.
* Arranging and playing a simple monophonic musical sequence.
* Composing and playing a whole song.
