In this talk, we will write a simple full-stack Scala web application. Not only would you have statically typed API communication between your backend server and your HTML frontend, but the entire frontend - from JS to HTML and CSS would be in your favorite language - Scala!

In this talk, we will use simple vanilla Scala to write a full-stack web application with the following highlights:

1. ScalaJs + scalatags + scalacss for JavaScript, HTML and CSS

2. The frontend will make Scala function calls e.g. backend.foo() which would be translated by the framework to AJAX calls to the backend. These calls would be statically typed i.e. it would be a compile error if frontend makes an API call that the backend does not support
