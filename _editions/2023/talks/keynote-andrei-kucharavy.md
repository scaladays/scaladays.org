Concepts borrowed from the theory of evolution have deeply permeated the language we use in the workplace. Organizational DNA, evolution of codebases, product niches, concept drift, survival of the fittest, ... - you name it. While they seem intuitive, they are all but, and their loose understanding and application make them about as counter-productive as productive.

However, there is a way to do it better. The Fitness Landscapes model - one of the core components of the modern evolutionary theory - focuses on code rewrites in the context of changing environment. And as such, it does not care if it operates on DNA code, software code, or ML model parameters coding.

This talk will present this code rewrite theory of evolution, some of its results, show how it can apply to code and ML, and try to use it to peer into what the future holds for the Scala community in particular and software development in general.
