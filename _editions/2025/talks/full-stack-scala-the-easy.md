It is easy and fun to develop a full stack application, strongly inspired from [Rock The JVM](https://rockthejvm.com/) incredible [ZIO rite of passage](https://rockthejvm.com/p/zio-rite-of-passage) this talk leverages:

* Scala 3 and ZIO both Server and Client side.
* Laminar UI framework
* Quill as data access layer.
* Tapir or ZIO RPC API call
* ScalablyTyped binding generation

All set up in 10 seconds:

* scaffolding with g8
* IDE setup
* build script - incremental builds and "hot" reload, backend and frontend.
* ready to deploy to K8S / ArgoCD
