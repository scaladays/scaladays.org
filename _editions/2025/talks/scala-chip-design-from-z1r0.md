Curious about hardware design but think it’s out of reach? This talk proves you can master it with Scala—no prior knowledge needed! We’ll:

1. Demystify hardware logic design from the ground up, making it accessible to all.
2. Unveil DFiant HDL (DFHDL), a Scala 3-powered, multi-abstraction hardware description language. With DFHDL’s automation, you’ll craft your own chip and send it to fabrication via Tiny Tapeout (tinytapeout.com, unaffiliated)—a fully open-source workflow.
3. Spotlight Scala 3 as DFHDL’s secret weapon, leveraging its cutting-edge features like type operations and checks, match types, compiler-plugin, contextual abstraction, named tuples, macros, and more. Real-world examples will showcase how Scala 3 transforms hardware design into a familiar, powerful experience.

From zero to hero, this talk equips Scala devs to conquer silicon!
