Everyone is used to coding remotely today, right? But how about mentoring junior engineers without an office? We thought it couldn’t work, but fortunately we decided to challenge this assumption and launched SoftwareMill Academy - which, like SoftwareMill itself, is 100% remote. And we successfully taught a group of junior developers Scala and functional programming in 3 months. Twice! 

For me, teaching others was the next step in my career as a senior Scala engineer. I already possessed the knowledge I wanted to share, but the challenge was to share it in a structured and approachable way. In this talk I’d like to share my story of going beyond programming and creating a demanding yet friendly environment for junior developers to learn. With two successful editions of the Academy already behind us, there's plenty of lessons learned!
