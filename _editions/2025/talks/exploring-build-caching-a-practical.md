Build caching can significantly improve your project's build times, but it can be tricky to implement effectively. This talk provides actionable insights into build caching and demonstrates how to leverage it within your sbt projects. We'll explore the evolution of build caching in Scala, share practical tips for maximizing sbt's current caching capabilities, and showcase the impact of these techniques on real-world projects like the Scala 3 repository and Pekko. Finally, we'll take a look ahead at the future of build caching in sbt 1 and 2, and offer guidance on how to prepare for the changes.
