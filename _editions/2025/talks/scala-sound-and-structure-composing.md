What do functional programming and Johann Sebastian Bach’s music have in common? More than you’d think. In this talk, we’ll explore how concepts from functional programming—immutability, pure functions, recursion—can be applied not just to code, but to creative processes like music composition. Using a sampler instrument built for the Sounds of Scala library we’ll generate melodies, and explore algorithmic music inspired by structures like Pascal’s Triangle and the Möbius strip. Along the way, we’ll connect music theory with functional patterns, showing how FP can act as a creative lens, not just a technical one. This talk is for developers curious about music, musicians curious about programming, and anyone interested in the intersection of maths and creativity.
