Scala often gets a reputation for being complex, especially among developers outside its community. Many see Java or Kotlin as more approachable options, thanks to their straightforward libraries and frameworks that solve most day-to-day problems without requiring a deep dive into advanced concepts like category theory.

But what if Scala could offer the same ease of use as Spring while still unlocking the full power of modern effect systems like Cats Effect or ZIO when needed?

In this talk, we'll explore how Scala can be just as approachable as mainstream Java frameworks for building backend applications without sacrificing its advanced capabilities. We'll start by showing how to create a simple backend using Spring in Scala, examining the benefits and tradeoffs. Then, we'll take it further, demonstrating how mission-critical applications can gain robustness and composability through effect systems without overwhelming complexity.

Finally, we’ll look at emerging solutions like YAES, which enable a direct, intuitive style while still delivering the core benefits of monadic effects—offering a smooth path between simplicity and power.
