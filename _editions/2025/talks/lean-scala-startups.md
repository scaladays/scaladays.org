Scala is extremely underrated for many reasons; a core one is Scala's sweet spot combo of simplicity, safety and convenience for product development.
Contrary to widespread belief, Scala can be incredibly fast for developing a startup: idea, development, launch, measurement, feedback, repeat.
I will share my first-hand experience with real-world examples.

By the end of the talk, you will get
- insights on the features of Scala that are important for products
- a set of principles, tools and libraries to use for product development
- (hopefully) inspiration and drive to write your own!
