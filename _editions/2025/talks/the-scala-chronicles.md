We have witnessed a remarkable transformation of the Scala language. What started as an ambitious blend of object-oriented and functional programming, has evolved through numerous paradigm shifts, passionate community debates, and technological revolutions. And we learned so much along the way.

In "The Scala Chronicles," we'll trace this 21-year journey, examining various "eras" of the Scala ecosystem—from early adoption as a JVM-based alternative to Java, through the actor model revolution with Akka, reactive streams, the functional programming renaissance with Scalaz and Cats, and finally to today's more pragmatic, beginner-friendly approaches.

We'll explore what drove each shift in the community's thinking, which ideas survived and which ones faded, and how the language itself accommodated these changing philosophies. You'll see actual code examples from different eras, demonstrating how the same problems were tackled using radically different approaches.

Whether you're a Scala veteran who lived through these transformations, a newcomer curious about the language's rich history, or a programmer who used Scala and shifted to another language, this talk offers valuable perspectives on how programming languages and their communities evolve.
