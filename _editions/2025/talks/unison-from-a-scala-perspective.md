Unison is a young programming language for the cloud, built in particular by the authors of the Scala Red Book and other people who are (or were) active in the Scala community. Unison distinguishes itself from traditional programming languages by re-inventing the foundations of code storage and deployment. By doing so, it unlocks a number of very interesting properties that are rather unique in the programming landscape.

This talk will be a quick introduction to the Unison "paradigm" and language, from the perspective of a long-standing Scala programmer. It'll highlight the benefit of this approach, as well as some of the caveats.
