- It is my belief that enterprise Scala/2.12, 2.13 Spark code is a gold mine of untapped potential for igniting Scala enthusiasm and driving wider-spread adoption (beyond Spark) ... and it's hiding in plain sight
- At Instacart, we are using [etl4s](https://github.com/mattlianje/etl4s) to tap into this potential, and write beautiful dataflows.
- Learn our field-tested "social hacking" techniques that overcome FP resistance:
     - Strategic language choices that don't trigger defensive reactions
     - Incremental abstractions that prove their value immediately
     - Tactics for making Scala's benefits undeniable, even to skeptics
- See how to plant functional "seeds" that grow like forest moss - separate at first, then beautifully interconnected
- Walk away with battle-tested strategies to make your team unable to look away from what Scala can truly deliver
