Concurrent and parallel programming can be challenging to test and debug, but it doesn't have to be. This talk will take a deep dive into strategies and techniques for testing concurrent and parallel code in Scala. From the basics of setting up tests to the advanced techniques for testing actors, futures and parallel collections, the talk will cover everything one needs to know to master testing for concurrent and parallel code. The talk will also cover best practices for writing testable code and how to test in cloud-native and containerized environments. All levels of developer - Beginners to Expert, are welcome in this talk which will provide them with the knowledge and tools to write and test robust, high-performing and thread-safe concurrent and parallel code in Scala. 

The talk will cover following topics -

-An overview of the importance of testing concurrent and parallel code in Scala, including the benefits of testing code at the unit level and the impact of concurrency bugs on system performance and reliability.

-An introduction to popular testing frameworks and tools for testing concurrent and parallel code in Scala, such as ScalaTest, scalatest-concurrent, and scalamock.

-A demonstration of how to use different types of tests (stateful, property-based, etc.) to test different aspects of concurrent and parallel code in Scala.

-A discussion of best practices for writing testable concurrent and parallel code in Scala, including using functional programming concepts, avoiding shared state, and writing small, focused functions.

-An overview of testing actors in Scala, including how to test actor interactions and how to test actors running in a distributed system.

-A demonstration of how to test futures and promises in Scala, including how to test parallel computations and how to test non-deterministic code.

-A review of some of the challenges of testing parallel collections in Scala, such as testing performance and testing code that runs in different parallel execution contexts.

-A discussion of how to use testing and test automation to improve the development and deployment process, including continuous integration and continuous delivery.

-An overview of testing Scala's concurrent and parallel code in cloud-native and containerised environments, such as Kubernetes and how to use tools such as test containers to run tests inside containers.

-A review of some of the challenges of testing distributed systems and how to address them, such as testing network failures, testing systems with high availability requirements, and testing systems running in different environments.
