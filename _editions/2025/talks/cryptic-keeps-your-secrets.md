Learn how to put encryption at the heart of your handling of sensitive data with __Cryptic__. You don't need to put everything in an encrypted data store, implementing elaborate find-and-purge routines for removing sensitive data or use any other intrusive all-or-nothing approach. Instead simply define the individual fields of your data structures that need protection using the `Encrypted`-typeclass and let __Cryptic__ do the heavy lifting for you. 

We will give you a gentle introduction into cryptography: best-practices, challenges and pitfalls. Then we will show you how __Cryptic__ offers a ready-to-use solution needing no configuration nor setup for the simple case. For advanced usage, all aspects of encryption can be configured according to your needs. We will also show how _Hardware Security Modules_ can be integrated and used together with __Cryptic__.
