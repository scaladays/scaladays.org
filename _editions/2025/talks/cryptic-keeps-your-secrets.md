Learn how to put encryption at the heart of your handling of sensitive data with Cryptic. You don’t need to put everything in an encrypted data store, implementing elaborate find-and-purge routines for removing sensitive data or use any other intrusive all-or-nothing approach. Instead simply define the individual fields of your data structures that need protection using the Encrypted-typeclass and let Cryptic do the heavy lifting for you.

We will give you a gentle introduction into cryptography: best-practices, challenges and pitfalls. Then we will show you how Cryptic offers a ready-to-use solution needing no configuration nor setup for the simple case. For advanced usage, all aspects of encryption can be configured according to your needs. We will also show how Hardware Security Modules can be integrated and used together with Cryptic.
