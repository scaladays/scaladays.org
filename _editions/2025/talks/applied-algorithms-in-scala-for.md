I will cover 2 key areas:

- Scala works well in both immutable and mutable fashion. C/Java/Python only enables monolithic mutable style as every stage is tighly coupled to the next, whereas Scala in addition enables a modular style because of being able to decompose mutability into distinct immutable performant stages that closely align with the way we communicate the algorithm, including examples.

- Algorithms as a widely used “standardised test” in the interview process and their day-to-day applications in a professional setting; confluence of AI and algorithmic intuition; how compiler/interpreter knowledge could become more relevant with the advent of AI, with concrete examples.
