In this talk, we will explore practical ways to work more efficiently with IntelliJ IDEA and the Scala Plugin. The focus will be on selected, often underrated capabilities that can noticeably improve workflow and productivity. We will also look at recent experimental features designed to make Scala development faster and smoother, including options that are still evolving and may not yet be widely known. In addition, there will be a brief look at how writing “IDE-friendly” Scala can further enhance the editing and analysis experience.

We will give an overview of the current Scala 3 support in the Scala Plugin — the progress achieved so far, what remains to be done, and the steady convergence between the evolving language and its tooling. We will also highlight the differences between implementing a language feature in the compiler and supporting it in a full-featured IDE.

Finally, we will discuss how the Scala community can contribute to and help shape the future of the Scala Plugin, from providing structured feedback to contributing code to the Scala Plugin.
