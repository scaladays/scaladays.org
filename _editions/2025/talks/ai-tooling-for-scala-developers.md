In the last few years, one of the leading new areas of development in JetBrains has been AI tooling. It started with simple access to an external Large Language Model within IntelliJ IDEA - but we didn’t stop there.

Today, JetBrains offers a wide range of new features and extensions that can make software developers work more quickly and productively. During this talk, we will go through the most important of them - AI Assistant, AI code completions, the integration of Model Context Protocol, and more. We will discuss how these tools can boost your productivity and improve your coding experience. We will also delve into… sorry, I mean, we will talk about JetBrains Junie, AI agents in general, and the future of AI tooling at JetBrains.

The talk will consist of live coding examples and pre-recorded videos.
