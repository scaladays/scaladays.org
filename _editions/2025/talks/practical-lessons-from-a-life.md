Software development is full of competing demands—speed, reliability, scalability, flexibility, and affordability. Everyone wants all of them, and they want them now. But building software that delivers on all these fronts is much harder than it seems.
Having used Scala as his primary language since 2010 and being deeply involved in its community, Rory has seen how different programming paradigms, tools, and mental models shape software development. This talk will explore key lessons from his career—how to think about software and software careers, the trade-offs of different paradigms and abstraction levels, and why for him Scala hits the sweet spot for building robust, scalable systems easily. Along the way, we will discuss real-world insights on tools, best practices, and how to navigate the ever-changing landscape of software engineering.
Whether you are new to software development or an old hand, this talk will give you perspectives and ideas to take into your future work.
