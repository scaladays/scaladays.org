Building production-ready backend services in Scala can be a daunting task, often requiring the integration of multiple libraries and extensive boilerplate code. But what if you could streamline this process and focus entirely on your business logic? Meet Pillars, the Scala library that does just that.

In this dynamic 45-minute session, I will demonstrate how Pillars can take you from zero to production in record time. By leveraging Pillars’ integration of well-known libraries, you can bypass the usual complexities of setting up observability (traces, metrics, and logs), database access, API calls, and feature flag management. Pillars handles these essential components out-of-the-box, along with built-in health checks and an admin server, allowing you to concentrate on what truly matters: your business case.

We’ll start from scratch and build a fully functional, production-ready backend service, which will be deployed in a live environment during the session. You’ll see firsthand how Pillars reduces the need for repetitive code, accelerates development, and enhances your ability to deliver robust and scalable services.

Whether you’re a seasoned Scala developer or just getting started, this session will provide you with actionable insights and practical knowledge. Walk away with the confidence and tools to streamline your own projects, making Scala development simpler and more efficient with Pillars.
