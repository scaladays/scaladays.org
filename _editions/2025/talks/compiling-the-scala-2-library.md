After several months of effort, weâ€™ve succeeded in compiling the Scala 2 standard library with Dotty, producing bytecode that is fully binary-compatible with the output of the Scala 2 compiler. This means the library is no longer frozen in time: we can now introduce fresh code written with Scala 3 features allowing the library to evolve.
