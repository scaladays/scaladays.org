How many companies miss out on functional languages because they do not know how to find functional programmers? After interviewing engineering leadership at four companies that have used Elm successfully, I found that they all independently chose to hire people without Elm experience and all got them fully onboarded in about four weeks. (That is competitive with the time it takes to onboard into a JavaScript/TypeScript project with particular in-house conventions and library combinations.) That means they get all the benefits of functional programming while still drawing from the largest possible talent pool. How does this work, and how can this method of growing your own functional programmers be useful to the broader ecosystem of functional languages?
