Scala has great tools, but businesses don't care about them.

Business4s is not another library, not another ecosystem—it's a push to make Scala more relevant in the business world. That means open-source solutions, guidelines, mentoring, or anything else that gets us to the goal. The aim is to shape Scala into a community known equally for its high technical quality and its business focus.

In this talk, I will share the vision behind Business4s, the challenges of making Scala more business-friendly, and what's already being done to change the status quo. I'll explain how we tackle boring enterprise problems so others don't have to and how we can build a space where Scala meets real-world business needs. Most importantly, how we can make Scala recognized as the most pragmatic, safe, scalable, and business-oriented programming language in the world.
