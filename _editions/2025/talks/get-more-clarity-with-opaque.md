Types are a programmer's best friend. In the pursuit to a perfect world, we try to model our domains in such a way that the type system makes incorrect data impossible. In Scala 2, we have tools like type aliases, value classes or Refined Types. In Scala 3, there's something new for this purpose - opaque type aliases. What do they bring to the table? Will they make our life easier? Do they have any drawbacks? Join this live demo to learn all that and add this new tool to your modelling toolbox!
