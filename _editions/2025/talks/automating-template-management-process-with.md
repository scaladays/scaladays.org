This just crept up on us. Being a team responsible for integrations with external communication providers (smses, emails, etc), one day we woke up realising that a lot of our work is managing changes to notification templates. Our system had evolved to be accidentally complex, navigating it took time and effort, and it was easy to make a mistake, causing incidents in production. We decided it's time to refactor and automate it. In this talk, I'd like to share how the Iron library and features from Scala 3 helped us build a solution which is safer, more robust, and easier to maintain.
