Type-Driven Development emphasizes that types are not only a means of preventing runtime errors, but also a powerful specification tool: a type signature specifies — albeit often partially — what a function is meant to accomplish, effectively guiding its implementation.
This talk aims to deepen our mastery of type-driven development through simple yet insightful exercises drawn from logic and algebra. We will explore the method by implementing type isomorphisms that correspond to familiar arithmetic laws (such as the exponential laws), and by demonstrating propositional tautologies using the Curry-Howard correspondence, where type signatures mirror logical formulas and program implementations serve as constructive proofs. Through these exercises, attendees will develop a sharper intuition for algebraic data types and a deeper appreciation for the role of type signatures in strongly-typed languages like Scala.
