The Scala 3 type system is powerful, but to use it effectively, you need to understand it. This talk offers a guided tour of its major features, covering types, bounds, kinds, variance, type lambdas, type and kind lattices, polymorphic functions, abstract types, and wildcard type arguments. You'll leave with mental models that will make the type system more intuitive and practical for your day-to-day Scala programming.
