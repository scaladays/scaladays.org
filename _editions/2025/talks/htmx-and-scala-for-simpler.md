HTMX is a frontend library that has gained popularity very rapidly.
It provides a much simpler way to write dynamic web apps than the traditional SPA frameworks.
In my talk I will show how to use it together with scala, with my small Sharaf framework.
Since HTMX is very popular and nice to use, I think that scala will also benefit from this "collaboration".
