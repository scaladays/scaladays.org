Typelevel is an ecosystem of projects and a community of people united to foster an inclusive, welcoming, and safe environment around functional programming in Scala. I first started contributing in 2021 and have since watched the seemingly exponential growth of our community and of our tech stack, in tandem.

A few of the stories I look forward to sharing are:
- How sbt-typelevel and the Typelevel affiliate program have enabled a community ecosystem of cross-platform libraries to blossom and flourish.
- How supporting Scala.js and Scala Native in Cats Effect inspired us to design a novel, high-performance asynchronous runtime for the JVM.
- How scala-cli, Typelevel Toolkit, and a Google Summer of Code student reduced the learning curve for getting started with the Typelevel stack.
