Bazel is known as a build system optimized for massive scale multi-language monorepos. But is it really so complex that you need dedicated developers to maintain a build? Or is it actually easy to start small and scale complexity as you go? Let's find out!

We will go through the setup of a simple Bazel project that builds Java and Scala code, and discuss how it can be expanded to any number of languages and size of project. I will present the tools and resources that can help you along the way, and give an overview of why (and why not) you might want to choose Bazel for your next project.
