Have you ever wondered what really happens under the hood of your Scala code? Join me for a practical introduction to compiler engineering through the lens of the Scala compiler. Drawing from my two years of experience participating in the Scala Compiler Spree, I’ll break down the compilation process, demystify common terminology, and share what it’s like to contribute to a complex and evolving codebase.

You’ll learn:

* Why compiler engineering can make you a better developer
* Compilation phases of the Scala compiler
* Key constructs and terminology every contributor should know
* How to approach and solve real issues
* My personal experiences participating in the Spree
* A potential improvement for the Scala compiler

Whether you’re curious about compiler internals or looking to contribute, this talk will give you a roadmap and the motivation to get started.
