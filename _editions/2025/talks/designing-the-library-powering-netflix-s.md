As Netflix expanded, the accumulation of diverse business metrics such as hours streamed, play delay, and rebuffers became increasingly complex, with contributions from a wide array of teams, from Data Scientists to Client Engineers. To address this complexity, Netflix required a centralized solution to define and manage these metrics across multiple systems.

In this presentation, we will explore the development of the Measures Library, a pivotal framework designed to streamline the definition and execution of business metrics. Leveraging the powerful features of Scala 3, such as Opaque Types, Type Classes, Macros, and Context Functions in a direct style approach to empower teams, even those with limited Scala expertise, to efficiently define and manage business measures, ultimately enhancing our dashboards and reports that drive critical decision-making at Netflix.

Join us to discover how the innovative use of Scala 3's unique capabilities significantly contributed to improving Netflix's Quality of Experience (QoE). This session will provide valuable insights into the practical application of advanced Scala features in a real-world, high-impact scenario.
