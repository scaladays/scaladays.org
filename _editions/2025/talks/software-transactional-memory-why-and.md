A detailed look at concurrent programming by a deep dive into software transactional memory:
- What is it? When is it useful? When it isn't?
- Subtleties of atomicity, consistency and isolation (What's opacity? Is STM different from DB transactions?)
- Why is functional programming uniquely well suited for STM?
- How to implement our own STM?
