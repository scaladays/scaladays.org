If you ever felt that something is missing in your IDE, that there are functionalities you would want to see in it, this talk is for you! Over the years, I’ve seen multiple people try and succeed implementing their features or bugfixes in the Scala Language Server. It turns out it’s not that hard and there's a unique satisfaction in creating something for yourself rather than just for a distant client.

In this session, I'll guide you through the steps to implement a simple code action—those helpful suggestions that pop up under the lightbulb in VS Code and other editors. We'll explore how to use the Scalameta parser, gather information from SemanticDB, and even connect it all with the compiler. I will explain advantages and problems with each approach we take to make it clear to you how your issue can be solved.

After the talk you should be able to get straight to your laptop and get cracking on the feature you always wanted. Or join me in one of our sprees, where we gather like minded people to make tooling better.
