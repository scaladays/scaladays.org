Based on my experience developing the Metals Scala language server, I realized that it’s really difficult for most users to unlock it’s full potential. While maintainers are aware of what might be happening and how to solve their issue it’s not so simple for others. In this talk I wanted to describe the issues users might encounter, how to deal with them and what can be done to improve it in the future. You should be able to make the tooling work for you not against you.

But we don’t want to only get focused on the problems and issues! We’ll also want to delve into some interesting features that can speed up your workflow and maybe sprinkle some AI magic on top of it. Tooling is the place where LLMs are bringing most value and it would be a shame not to include this in the talk.

After this session I would like everyone to be able to work more efficiently with Metals or at least be more conscious of where the roadblocks lie.
