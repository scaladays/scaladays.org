Ever wondered what Scala sounds like with an electric guitar running through it? We'll do it live!

Few sounds are as iconic as that of an electric guitar played through an overdriven amplifier. Since the first effects pedals hit the market in the early sixties, guitarists have been using them to take that sound to even greater heights. Now, more than six decades later, itâ€™s difficult to imagine life without my heavily curated pedalboard.

But what if we tried? Could we recreate these effects using functional Scala? As it turns out, we have a lot of very nice tools to work with.

Take a tour of Arpeggio with me: a guitar pedalboard built with FS2.
