Scala is powerful, no doubt—but are we really getting the most out of it when it comes to productivity? In this talk, we’ll explore how to boost not just coding speed, but the entire software development lifecycle—from idea to maintenance. I’ll share what working with dozens of painful Scala projects and over 12 years of focus on developer productivity has taught me, and how those lessons apply in the age of AI-assisted tools.

We’ll also take a step back and ask: How much does the choice of programming language matter in the era of AI? And could Scala be more than just a great language?
