Scala has historically lagged behind C, C++ and Rust in developing native code, partially due to its reliance on the JNI for native interaction. This resulted in limited adoption for many applications, such as embedded systems.

However, recent developments in the Scala ecosystem have bridged the gap with native languages. In this talk, we'll compare Scala Native and GraalVM Native Image, focusing on code complexity, production-readiness and applicability for embedded and serverless systems. 

Which technology offers the lowest startup/run times? What ecosystem is more mature? Which solution is more suitable for low-level embedded requirements? And which one better integrates with native languages? Attendees will walk away with answers to these questions and practical insights for selecting the right native technology for their Scala applications.
