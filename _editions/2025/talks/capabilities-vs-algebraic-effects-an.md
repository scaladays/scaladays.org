This talk will explore the characteristics of Capabilities from the perspective of an effect system developer. It will examine how capabilities and algebraic effects differ in their semantics, implementation, and usability across various dimensions. We'll compare how each approach handles different classes of effects - from side effects and state management to more complex patterns like backtracking, batching, and streaming. Using concrete examples from Kyo and Caprese, we'll analyze the tradeoffs in expressiveness, performance characteristics, and developer experience. The presentation will provide a balanced assessment of both approaches, giving attendees insights into how capabilities and algebraic effects might shape Scala's future.
