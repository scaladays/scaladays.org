Complex code will follow throughout the entirety of your career. Developers tend to take it like the weather - it’s something you can’t change, and you hope you’ll be lucky next time. But is this the best way to tackle it? 

The talk will cover the problem of code complexity. I’ll talk about where to look for it, how to assess the damage it causes and how to make the situation better for your future self and team. 

From my experience, I’ve noticed that the complexity introduced by a developer strongly correlates to the Dunning-Kruger effect (Confidence - Competence curve), while this topic is relevant to a broad audience, it will be especially useful for the developers with 2-5 years of experience - who are close to the peak of so called “Mount Stupid”. As someone not far from the peak myself, I was inspired to write this talk to share my experience.
