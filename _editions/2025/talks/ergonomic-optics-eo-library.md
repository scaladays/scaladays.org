In this talk, we will briefly introduce **EO** and how *extension methods* and *scala*'s powerful type system can ultimately provide an effortless developer experience to quickly combine their own, small, methods along with the structured navigation provided by **EO** to replace much bulkier alternatives.

We will quickly show how **EO** can work across common *database operations*, *replace the visitor pattern*, *implement codecs*, and if given enough time, show a codec implemented with optics that *avoids de-serializing and re-serializing data*, instead operating directly on the target type. Effective being *"zero-copy"* by avoiding full object tree de-serialization without compromising the application developer's experience.
