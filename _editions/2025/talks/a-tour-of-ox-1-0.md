Ox provides a toolkit for safe concurrency and resiliency for Scala on the JVM. After two years of prototyping, we're delighted to showcase the final product. With Ox, you can build and deliver direct-style Scala applications today.

In the code-first presentation, we'll begin with concurrency (including lower-level structured concurrency scopes and higher-level concurrency operators). Next, we'll proceed to Ox's approach to error management and type safety in that area. We’ll then explore Ox’s direct-but-reactive streaming library before concluding with its built-in resiliency toolkit.

Software is never finished, so we'll also share what lies ahead for Ox specifically and our plans for direct-style Scala generally.
