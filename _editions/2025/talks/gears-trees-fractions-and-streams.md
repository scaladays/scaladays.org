I am not a good mathematician, but have always been amazed at the clever solutions mathematicians have created. As a programmer I am especially excited when the mathematics has both a practical application and a connection to computation. This talk will focus on demonstrating, in Scala 3, the "Stern-Brocot" tree, originally used to optimize gear ratios for clocks. While learning the mathematics we will model the structures using familiar techniques like trees, and perhaps unfamiliar techniques involving lazy computation. This talk should be interesting to anyone with an interest in mathematics and programming.
