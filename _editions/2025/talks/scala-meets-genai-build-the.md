Talk Description:
Can you build the coolest GenAI apps in Scala? Yes!
LLM4S is the batteries-included toolkit for all your AI needs—basic LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), image understanding, and agentic workflows.

In this talk, Kannupriya Kalra, co-creator and maintainer of LLM4S, shares the story of how and why this toolkit was built, the key ideas behind it, and how community-driven development through Google Summer of Code helped expand its capabilities.

We’ll walk through live demos—from basic LLM calls and RAG search to image processing and AI-driven code writing. If you're curious about building powerful, production-ready GenAI applications in Scala, this session is for you.

With GenAI and LLM4S, you can build:

Conversational agents and intelligent chatbots

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) over custom datasets

Automated code generation and Scala-aware developer tools

Image captioning, generation, and understanding

PDF and document summarization and question-answering

Semantic search engines for unstructured data

AI agents that plan, reason, and call tools

Multi-step workflows combining text, data, and APIs

Content generation for blogs, reports, and marketing

Scalable GenAI-powered backend services in pure Scala

Whether you're building tools for developers, enterprises, or creative applications, this talk will show you how to harness the full power of GenAI in the coolest language: Scala.
