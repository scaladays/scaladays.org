Named tuples are a powerful addition to Scala 3 that combines the flexibility of tuples with the clarity of named fields. This talk provides a deep dive into named tuples. We will start with basic examples of how they can be used in our everyday code, and we will discuss whether or not they should replace regular case classes. We will take a brief look at how named tuples are represented internally by the compiler. Building on this foundation, we will explore some advanced features related to named tuples, including type-level programming, structural types, and the `Selectable` trait—showing how these concepts work together to enable safe, dynamic field access and intuitive API design. Through practical examples, we will learn how named tuples can simplify the design of library APIs and DSLs, focusing on use cases such as working with JSON or constructing SQL queries. We will also demonstrate how named tuples can (sometimes) replace higher-kinded types to improve code readability and usability. Finally, we will address the limitations of named tuples with examples of scenarios where they might not be the best fit—helping attendees understand both their strengths and boundaries.

Attendees will leave with a solid understanding of named tuples, actionable insights, and fresh ideas for leveraging this feature in their own projects or libraries. Whether you’re building DSLs, APIs, or exploring type-safe programming paradigms, this talk will inspire new ways to leverage Scala 3’s features effectively.
