Many technical professionals suffer from impostor syndrome – a crippling anxiety that they are not “good enough” or “qualified enough” to do the job they currently have. This impacts individual, team and organizational performance as fear of failure replaces confidence. This leads to increasingly “safe” choices that hinder innovation and output. 

Through her own story as the sole female on a team of engineers working on highly technical projects, Dr. Trego brings audiences along on her journey to overcome the impostor syndrome. This program not only inspires, but also educates audiences about how technical organizations can foster a culture of confidence in their staff.
