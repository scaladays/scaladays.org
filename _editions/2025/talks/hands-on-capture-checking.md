Capture checking is an experimental Scala feature and one of the building blocks of the very trendy direct style programming. It's also, not to put too fine a point on it, a little confusing. In this live coding session, we will explore the aspects that most Scala users will be exposed to, as understood by a regular developer after poring over the very academic documentation and experimenting with nightly builds. Fortunately for everybody involved, Martin will be there to correct the most egregious mistakes and provide whatever context is needed.
