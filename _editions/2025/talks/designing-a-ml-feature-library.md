title: "Designing a ML feature library from scratch!"

One of the core components of a modern machine learning system is the creation, transformation and composition of "features" which are used as inputs to machine learning and inference systems. In this talk we'll learn what a machine learning "feature library" is and build one in Scala in an iterative process. At the end we'll have a solid understanding of a core part of modern ML infrastructure, along with how to build a solid, compositional programming library in Scala 3.
