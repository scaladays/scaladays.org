Learning web development from books and courses rarely prepares you for the messy reality: broken configs, missing tests, outdated dependencies, and vague documentation. This talk shares my journey of building a real-world Scala web app—from scratch.

Coming from a strong backend and big data background, I set out to build a library management system for the Franco-Ukrainian Toloka Association using the TypeLevel stack: Http4s, Doobie, Cats Effect, and Tyrian with ScalaJS. Along the way, I faced common pain points: choosing tools, wiring pieces together, onboarding contributors, and keeping motivation alive when working solo.

This is not just a tech talk. It’s about building in public, learning through mistakes, finding support in the community, and the challenges of growing a pet project into something collaborative. Whether you’re exploring functional web development or building passion projects, you’ll leave with real-world insights—and maybe fewer illusions.
