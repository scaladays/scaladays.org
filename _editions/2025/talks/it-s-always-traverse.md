It's a maxim in functional programming that the answer to your problem is always traverse. Do you have a list of work and a way to do one of them asynchronously, but want to produce a single async value with all of the results? Traverse! Want to convert an optional action to an action with an optional result? Traverse!

This talk will teach you:
- what is the traverse function;
- how it's implemented for various types; and
- many examples of its use, both familiar and unfamiliar!

After this talk you'll be able to seriously respond to a coding problem with "oh, it's traverse!".
