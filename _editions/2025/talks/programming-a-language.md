Programming languages are a large amount of our day to day work and, for some of us, our hobbies. And I am very much of the opinion that in order to fully understand our tools, we must be able to make them ourselves.

In this talk, I will show you how to create a programming language from scratch. You will come away from this with a deeper understanding of, and insights on, your tools. It will also teach you what you need to write powerful DSLs, which in my experience can be an absolute game changer when maintaining software whose purpose I'm not an expert on, but I do have access to experts.
