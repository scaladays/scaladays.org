Dependent types greatly improve the expressiveness of the language, allowing to write safer programs and making more illegal states unrepresentable. Scala supports dependent typing for its functional programming constructs â€” methods and functions. However, when it comes to the object-oriented side of the language, dependent typing with classes requires significantly more effort. In this talk, I will present new language features that further streamline using dependent types in Scala. Specifically, I will motivate the use of dependent types, explain how we handle dependent classes in the compiler, introduce the tracked modifier, and describe other improvements for tracking precise types.
