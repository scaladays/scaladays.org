In all the teams I've been part of, with all the people I've mentored or collaborated with in one way or another, one of my first tasks always seems to be to teach how to work together in a way that is not simply rude.

I'm not talking about tone, although that is important. Neither is this about keeping it professional, there are far too many people around who would call me out on that particular bit of hypocrisy. No, the point I want to make is really about having the good manners not to have critical knowledge about code you wrote and choose to hide it from your teammates. Of not laying traps for collaborators, traps that will at best waste a few hours of their time and at worse get them to should the blame for massive production outages.

And if you think you're not guilty of these crimes, I'm willing to bet you're wrong. I am in fact willing to bet you've done that _today_ (provided you're reading this in the evening of a work day, obviously). But it's also a pretty safe bet you're not aware you've done just that.

The purpose of this talk, then, is to show some of the ways we can end up being incredibly rude without meaning to, and how to, well, not do that. To give you a set of simple rules to make your code feel like it's been written by a truly courteous person. Because, after all, manners maketh developer.
