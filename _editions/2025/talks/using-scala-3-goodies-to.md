The AWS SDK for Java 2.x is an officially recommended way to access DynamoDB from your application. While it offers a comprehensive and up-to-date Java Builder API, using it from Scala code requires a lot of code to build the requests needed and perform data transformations. With the advent of Scala 3 metaprogramming, named tuples and structural typing, most of this can be nicely automated and hidden behind an elegant, Scala-idiomatic API. The presentation will walk the attendees through different aspects of using the AWS SDK for Java 2.x API and how the experience of the Scala developer could be considerably improved. All examples will stem from my open-sourced, ready-to-use, tested in production library https://github.com/encalmo/scala-aws-client.
