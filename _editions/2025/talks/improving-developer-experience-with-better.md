The builder pattern is a tried-and-true solution in the object-oriented world to incrementally create a structured value. In this talk we'll talk about the history and use case of the pattern--when do we need builders?--and how we can model them in Scala. Can other techniques improve how we design the builders, and perhaps the end user experience? We'll examine various aspects such as optionality and overrides, which are especially important in ever-changing enterprise environments. You'll learn how and why to apply this pattern to your codebases, along with consistent ways to offer the functionality.
