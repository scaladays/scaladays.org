In my talk I will present a Scala-based tool called rig. Rig is a command line tool that manages an opinionated, self-hosted (either literally on user's hardware, dedicated server or on a cloud providers' VMs) Platform-as-a-Service based on Besom & Pulumi. Rig provides a plethora of useful services like auth, monitoring, log handling, tracing, uptime measurement, notifications and alerts that come preconfigured and ready to use with your new, shiny Scala-based apps. It also offers services that are useful for product development like customer feedback app, commenting engine and privacy-oriented analytics! All services are backed using tried and true open source projects. Rig gives the user the full flexibility to build whatever is needed by configuring the deployments using the full power of Pulumi while also offering helpful guardrails to speed up the most common use cases.
