Open source isn’t just for senior devs—it’s one of the easiest (and most rewarding) ways to grow your career, especially in the Scala world. In this talk, Kannupriya Kalra—Scala Center org admin and mentor for Google Summer of Code 2024–25, and co-creator of LLM4S—shares how getting involved in projects like Scaladex, Scala CLI, and LLM4S (or even something aligned with your interests in art, music, or gaming) can seriously boost your skills, confidence, and connections.
With over a decade of experience in functional programming and a strong OSS mentorship background, she’ll talk about how open source gives you direct access to some of the most skilled, supportive people in tech. You'll gain hands-on experience in real-world coding, collaboration, community-building, and even public speaking—all without paying for expensive bootcamps.
Whether you're just starting out or looking to level up, this talk will help you find your entry point, explore your passions, and show you why the OSS community is one of the best places to grow—both personally and professionally.
