Yes, you can build Scala projects with the Gradle Build Tool! Support for Scala, in fact, is a part of Gradle’s core repository, and there are dozens of plugins available. But what do Scala developers actually say about Gradle, and how does Gradle address the feedback?

In this session, Oleg will summarize the feedback, success and not so stories the Gradle team has received from Scala devs, and compare the notes with the audience. Then, we will talk about the direction of Gradle and integrations for Scala, and how one can leverage Scala experience when developing Gradle builds in Kotlin DSLs, in both functional and object-oriented ways. And could “s” in the “.kts” extension actually stand for Scala? :)
