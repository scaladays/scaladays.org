Building GenAI features is one thing—operating them reliably in production is another. In this talk, we’ll dive into how we’ve architected and scaled real-time Generative AI systems using Scala, FS2, and Server-Sent Events (SSE), with a particular focus on integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground LLMs in dynamic business data.

We’ll explore the challenges of serving low-latency responses to thousands of users, streaming outputs token-by-token, and orchestrating document retrieval pipelines on the fly. Expect practical insights on managing memory pressure, backpressure, observability, error handling, and model fallbacks—all in the wild.

If you're building production-ready GenAI services—chatbots, assistants, or document QA systems—this talk will equip you with the architectural patterns, tooling, and hard-earned lessons needed to scale them with confidence.
