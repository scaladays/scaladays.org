### Abstract

Just as Scala has transformed the way we build applications with functional programming, ZIO makes it easy to build provably correct systems and APIs to connect to them. With a focus on functional Scala and a real world application, this workshop is a practical way to learn full stack Scala 3 with ZIO and related libraries


### Target Audience 

- Developers at all levels (junior, mid, senior) comfortable with the Scala language
- Anyone interested in the ZIO stack, Laminar and ScalaJS in a real life setting
- Technical decision-makers curious whether the ZIO stack a suitable toolkit for a full-stack application


### Prerequisites

Comfort with the Scala language including given/using clauses and functional programming essentials, and general understanding of basic concurrency principles.


### Requirements

You’ll need a laptop with an IDE setup for basic Scala projects.

#### Part 3: Frontend with Laminar
- How Laminar works
- Rendering, functional reactive programming
