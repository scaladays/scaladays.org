  Conference tickets give access to all scheduled sessions including lunch, coffee breaks, the welcome reception, and the community party. During your registration process, we ask you kindly to let us know if you will participate in surrounding social events, it helps us place orders and avoid wasting food. Exclusive and discounted tickets are available per demand for sponsors, group (5+) tickets, and awarded members. Please email info@scaladays.org for assistance. Students can directly buy discounted tickets by choosing the “Student - Conference” Ticket and providing a valid student ID is required. We also encourage individuals who have limited education budgets or otherwise are self-funded, joining from lower income countries, to reach out to the organizers, info@scaladays.org.
