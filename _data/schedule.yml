  about: I’m a fourth-year PhD student at EPFL doing research in the overlap between
    programming languages and databases. I’m super excited about language integrated
    queries, logic programming, and recursive query optimization. I love hiking, road
    biking, climbing, and am most happy when I can do my work outdoors.
